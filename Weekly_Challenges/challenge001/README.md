#Challenge no: 001

## Challenge Question:

As a solutions architect, you have been entrusted with the responsibility of designing a
three-tier architecture for a company that currently has a one-tier architecture. The
company has recognized the need to upgrade its infrastructure to be highly available,
reliable, cost-effective, and secure, and has turned to you for a solution.

In addition to designing the three-tier architecture, you will need to ensure that it is highly
available and reliable. This means that the architecture must be able to handle high
volumes of traffic, prevent single points of failure, and recover quickly from any
disruptions.

In Challenge 1, you will need to draw a detailed diagram of the three-tier architecture that
you would use to solve the problem mentioned above. Your diagram should clearly show
the different layers of the architecture, including the presentation layer, the application
layer, and the data layer, and how they interact with each other. Your diagram should also
include any components that are necessary to support the architecture, such as load
balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases [Hint: Use draw.io to come 
up with the diagram].
